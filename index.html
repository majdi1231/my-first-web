        Pizza (English: /ˈpɪtzə/ PIT-zə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
        consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
        various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables,
        meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small
        pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
        A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
